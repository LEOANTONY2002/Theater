## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 AI-Powered Discovery
Forget generic "Trending Now" lists. Theater uses **Google Gemini** to understand your unique taste.
- **Just For You**: Recommendations based on your deep viewing history and watchlist patterns.
- **Mood Match**: Tell the AI how you're feeling (e.g., "I want something uplifting but not cheesy"), and get the perfect suggestion.
- **Thematic Analysis**: The AI analyzes plot lines to tag content with emotional and thematic markers (e.g., "Revenge & Redemption", "Mind-Bending Reality"), enabling you to find movies that *feel* the same, not just look the same.

### 💬 Cinema Chat
Have a conversation with your personal film expert.
- Ask for recommendations: *"I liked Inception, what should I watch next?"*
- Get trivia: *"Tell me a fun fact about the production of Dune."*
- Find specific scenes: *"What's that movie where they fight in a rotating hallway?"*

Your data belongs to you.
